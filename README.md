# Habit Tracker
Console based application for tracking a daily habit.

Developed using C#/.Net 8 and SQLite.
## Features

* **SQLite database**
  - the application uses an SQLite database to store and retrieve data
  - if a database doesn't exist it's created on startup
  - database is seeded with data generated by [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus) NuGet package
    
* **ConsoleUI**

  - console based UI where users can navigate to an option with arrow keys
  - menu is displayed using [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console) NuGet package
    
* **CRUD database operations**
  - create, update and delete records or view all records for a selected habit
  - create a new habit and set a unit of measurement
  - display a previous week of records for a selected habit
